The Questions class involved refactoring the categories of questions (pop, science, rock, sports) into a dictionary.
This allows for simpler implementation of added question categories should the need arise in the future.
The for loop iterates through the dictionary using the key value (name of the question genre) within a nested
loop of the range in the number of questions.
This is done in order to quickly create the statements for each question number & category since the categories share
the same statement formatting along with the same number of questions.
