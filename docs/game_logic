This file imports base classes to be inherited by the Game class.
An instance of the Game class is created within the __main__ block of the file.
The code in the __main__ block was left alone to demonstrate the unchanged client-side code.
The Player class and Questions class are both inherited by the Roll class, which is inherited by the
Process Answer class.

There are no conflicting method names between base classes.
Method Resolution Order:
Players -> Questions -> Roll -> ProcessAnswer -> Game
