Roll
====
The Roll class is responsible for handling the random player rolls that are passed into the roll method inside
the Game class.

The conditional statements in the "_current_category" method has been reduced to fewer lines (avoids repetition).

The conditional statements within the "roll_logic" method resolve to refactored helper methods.
This allows for better readability and gives the developer a better sense of the high-level purpose of the code.
