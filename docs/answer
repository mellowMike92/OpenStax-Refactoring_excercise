ProcessAnswer
=============
The answer.py file contains the ProcessAnswer class which inherits from the Roll base class
The Roll class can be found in the roll.py file.

ProcessAnswer is responsible for processing the answer by deciding whether or not the answer was correct through
conditional checks, and shows how to increment the player's place and reward the coins.

There were a few repeated code blocks that were refactored into the method "_correct_outside_penalty_box".
